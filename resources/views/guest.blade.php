    <h2 style='text-align:center;'>Real Life Achievements</h2>
<div style='margin-left:16px;'>
    <p>
    If you're here, you probably know about video game achievements but incase you don't... 
    </p>
    <p>
    Achievements are goals that are set by game developers (or even other players) to encourage people to try different avenues of gameplay they may not have thought of. Beating a game non-volently is a common example. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Real life achievements are that same mentality applied to the real world. There have been many different implementations of real life achievements. Most of them have video game themes or focus on the gamification.
    </p>
    <p>
    This avoids that. This is simple and social. Do it. Prove it. 
    </p>
</div>
    <h4>Do It</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Be specific.</span> If you lost weight, say how much. Be as specific as possible with the limited amount of characters that are available to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Keep it short.</span> You have 140 characters for your achievement title, so keep it as short as possible. Keeping it short also makes it easier to read.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Prove It</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Post proof.</span> Whatever kind of proof you have, post it. If it's pictures, post it on <a href='http://imgur.com'>Imgur</a>. If it's a video, post it on <a href='http://youtube.com'>YouTube</a>. If it's an online accomplishment, just post a link to the relevant webpage. Whatever the proof is, just copy and paste post the link. <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Faking proof is a bannable offense.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Vote.</span> When you post your proof, the community will decide if your proof is adequate. If you're creating a new achievement, then everyone on the site can vote on it. If you're posting proof to an already created achievement, only those that have already completed it can vote. 
        </li>
    </ul>
     <h4>Voting Guidelines</h4>
     <p style='margin-left:16px;'>
        Ultimately, the way things are run will be decided by the community, but here are some general guidelines for voting:
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Don't be a dick.</span> People who are abusive will be banned, from messaging, from commenting or from the site.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Be charitable.</span> If an achievement is titled,"Lose five pounds." and the person lost only 4.5 pounds. Don't vote them down based on that.             
                It's important that we verify these accomplishments but it's also just as important that we don't actively look for reasons to not verify them. Allegations that someone is faking proof should not be done lightly. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
