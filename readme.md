#RLA#

In case you can't tell, this is built on Laravel. 

This is a Real Life Achievements site. This is the third iteration and I seriously hope it's the one that gets completed. It's a simple concept. You do something that's awesome. You post it up with proof. People vote on whether the proof applies and its up. Then other people try and achieve that same thing. It's simple.
